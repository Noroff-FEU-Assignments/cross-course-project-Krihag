      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would inform the client about the most common security threats to be
      aware of. Theese are for example: SQL injection, cross site scripting and
      cross site request forgery. I would then explain them the importance of
      staying up to date on the latest security threats and what they need to
      look out for. I would also advice them about the current best security
      measures and practices to always keep in mind.
